BlissInvite was born out of the desire to use our collective creativity and energy to bring about an enduring and beautiful product. After several weekends of diligent brainstorming, we picked the one idea that allowed us to express our interests in different ways, but united us around the central idea of building an enduring and scalable company.

We envisioned BlissInvite to be a place where the coder codes; the designer designs; and the connectors and execution masters lead and carry us forward. That is indeed exactly what happened.

So we pressed on the gas with a strong desire to solve real problems and help make the world a better place. All of us here at BlissInvite are sentimental and romantic—our card collection reflects this. And our “Mark Your Beginning by Giving” campaign will help a couple in need in the US every time you place an order on our site.

Our team is comprised of left brainers and right brainers, sometimes in the same person. This can come in handy when you are building a company, so long as you know which side of the brain is talking…
