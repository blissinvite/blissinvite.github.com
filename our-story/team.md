BlissInvite was born out of the desire to bring our collective creativity and energy to create something enduring and beautiful. After several weekends of diligent brainstorming and validating different disruptive ideas, we picked the one that allowed us to express our interests in different ways but unite us around the central idea of building an enduring and scalable company.

We envisioned BlissInvite to be a place where the coder will code, the designer will design, while the connectors and execution masters lead and carry us forward.  That is indeed exactly what happened. 

So we pressed on the gas with a strong desire to solve real problems and help make the world a better place.  All of us here at BlissInvite are sentimental and romantics; this is reflected through our card collection. And our â€œmark your beginning by giving" campaign will help a couple in need in the US every time you place an order on our site.

Our team is comprised of left brainers and right brainers, sometimes in the same person. This can come in handy when you are building a company as long as you know which side of the brain is talking...
