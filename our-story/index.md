**Invitations Reimagined**

*We founded Bliss Invite on a single premise: that you don’t have to completely leave the old behind to make way for the new*, and you won't have to compromise design for the sake of efficiency. We’ve made both efficiency and elegance our top priority—from our beautifully designed cards and web applications to our friendly customer service. 

**Why BlissInvite? **

Finding the right invitation card is overwhelming. Thousands of options present themselves every day, and you can spend what seems like an endless series of weekends in search for just the right card. 
If you’re looking for timeless design and understated elegance, you’ve come to the right place. By working with talented designers, we’ve narrowed down our selection of beautifully crafted invitation cards to just the top fifteen. Through our elegantly designed site and services, we introduce our designers to the national stage and our customers to top talent. 


**Why invitations?**

In this high-tech age of rapid-fire emails, tweets, and SMS, people share important messages in rather forgettable ways.  We believe carefully composed invitations, printed on fine paper you can actually touch and feel, make a strong, lasting impression (and in the case of weddings, set the special tone for the big day).   

We want to marry the old and the new, by keeping the age-old art of card making, calligraphy printing and design alive in this era of emails and tweets.

Unfortunately, the process of mailing invitations hasn’t changed much since the conception of snail mail.  And while technology can address the resulting inefficiencies, it should not compromise the tradition of sending and receiving inked correspondences. This is why we’ve designed a one-of-a-kind system to address both issues.

**How do we do it ?**

Our newly developed web application allows our customers to a) easily collect their guests’ mailing addresses, b) manage their RSVP list and c) buy beautiful cards. 

From then on, we take care of the rest—from carefully assembling and addressing the envelope by hand with beautiful calligraphy, to mailing the invitations directly to your guests.

1. Import your contacts and automatically collect their mailing address - no need to text or send your friends individual Facebook messages to remind them to RSVP.  
2. Select your preferred invitation suite (standard, premium, or luxury) from our collection. Allow us to introduce you to the delightful, sumptuous world of letterpress to add a luxurious dimension to your wedding.
3. Relax. We will stuff the envelopes and address them with beautiful calligraphy, stamping them one card at a time 

**What defines the quality of a card?**

Paper type, printing technique and craftsmanship. Bliss Invite provides cards that fulfill all three. 

**We are different in two ways:**

1. *We are a full-service invitation management company* OWe sell our products and services in one package, and offer simple, three-tier pricing: Standard, Premium and Luxury. Each package includes:
  * a. A suite of invitation cards  
  * b. A web application that allows you to manage your invitations from beginning to end, starting with the collection of guest addresses, RSVP management, etc. 
  * c. Envelope assembly, hand-addressing and calligraphy   

2. *We source our design directly from local designers.* Our web-based, curated approach allows you to have access to amazingly talented designers without having to drive around and scout brick and mortar boutique shops, saving you time and money. Our designers’ passion for craft comes through in the sumptuous quality of their work.
