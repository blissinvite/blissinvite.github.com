Bliss Invite was founded on the premise that we donâ€™t have to completely leave the old behind to make way for the new. We asked ourselves can we marry the old and the new and make it possible to easily buy boutique-quality invitations, crafted by local designers passionate about their craft?

<h2>Why invitations?</h2>

<p>Our cards are hand picked and curated especially for a sophisticated couple, that love art, design and technology and are looking to buy high quality cards in an efficient manner. We carry cards that are designed by local artisans that are very passionate about their craft and the passion is reflected through the quality of the cards. With a few clicks our customers can buy beautifully crafted luxury cards and not worry about stuffing and labeling/addressing envelopes. </p>

<h2>What defines the quality of a card</h2>
<p>Paper type, printing technique and craftsmanship. Bliss Invite cards fulfills all three promises </p>

<h2>We are very different in two ways:</h2>

<p>We are a full service invitation management company
Our products and services are sold as one package. And we have a simple three tier pricing, standard, premium and Lux. Included in each package is a
a. suite of cards that you will need for your wedding day 
b. web application that allows you to manage the invitation from beginning to end, starting with guest address collection, RSVP management, 
c. envelope assembly, hand addressing and calligraphy  </p>

<p>We source our design directly from local designers
Our web-based curated sales approach allows you to have access to amazingly talented designers without driving around and scouting through brick and mortar boutique shops saving you time and money. </p>
