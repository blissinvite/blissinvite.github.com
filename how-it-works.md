Elegant Solution

In an effort to bring high touch to this high tech era the team at Bliss Invite deconstructed the science of exchanging correspondence and mailing invitations to present an elegant and simple solution to the world.

Our technology team developed a web application that allows our customers to: 

(1) build their guest list by importing their contacts from social media sites or email accounts 
(2) use a slick online form to collect their guest’s mailing addresses 
(3) order our free sample kit to touch and feel the cards and choose their card 
(4) have their invitation mailed directly to their guests(customers don’t have to worry about stuffing and addressing envelopes) 
(5) manage their RSVP list 

Furthermore, customers on our site can send us a picture from their honeymoon and we will create and mail their thank you note directly to their guests. 

Our cards are hand picked and curated especially for the busy and sophisticated couple that love art, design and technology and are looking to buy high quality cards in an efficient manner. We carry cards that are designed by local artisans that are very passionate about their craft and the passion is reflected through the quality of the cards. 

To sum it up, BlissInvite provides an end to end solution needed to mail high quality personalized invitations with beautiful calligraphy.
