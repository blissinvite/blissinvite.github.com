<h2>Elegant Solution<h2> 

<p>In an effort to bring high touch to this high tech era the team at Bliss Invite deconstructed the science of exchanging correspondence and mailing invitations to present an elegant and simple solution to the world.</p>  

<h2>Our team developed a web application that allows you to:</h2> 

<p>(1) Build your guest list by importing your contacts from social media sites or email accounts</p> 
<p>(2) Use a slick online form to collect your guest’s mailing addresses</p>
<p>(3) Order our free sample kit to touch and feel the cards and choose the one that you like</p>
<p>(4) Have your invitation hand-addressed with beautiful caligraphy and mailed directly to your guests(you don’t have to worry about stuffing envelopes)</p>
<p>(5)manage your RSVP list</p>
 
<h3>Furthermore, you can send us a picture from your honeymoon and we will create and mail your thank you note directly to your guests.</h3>
 
<p>Our cards are hand picked and curated especially for our busy customers that love art, design and technology and are looking to buy high quality cards in an efficient manner. We carry cards that are designed by local artisans that are very passionate about their craft and their passion is reflected through the quality of the cards.</p>
 
<p>If you are looking for an end to end solution needed to mail high quality paper personalized invitations with beautiful calligraphy, you have come to the right place.</p>
