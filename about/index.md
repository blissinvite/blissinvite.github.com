<p><strong>Bliss Invite was founded on the premise that we donâ€™t have to completely leave the old behind to make way for the new. And we don't have to compromise design for sake of efficency, so we made both efficiency and elegant design our priority in all what we do, from our beautiful designed cards and website application to our customer service .</p>
</p>Why invitations?</p>

<p>As Engineers and Designers, we love to build and create things with our hands and appreciate the mechanics of machines. Interestingly we found all of those things we love in paper card making and ofcourse software engineering. We love the classic print machinerys from the 1800s and the loud roaring sound of the printing presses. Our print designers feel a tremendous amount of pride working their craft. And we want to bring back the lost art of calligraphy back, the days where hand pressed correspondence was the official form of communication. So we said to ourselves, how do we marry the old and the new. How do we keep the art of card making,calligraphy printing and design alive in this age of emails and tweets? And why do we need to keep it alive?</p>
