<p><strong>Invitations Reimagined
Bliss Invite was founded on the premise that we don’t have to completely leave the old behind to make way for the new. And we don't have to compromise design for sake of efficiency. So we made both efficiency and elegant design our priority in all what we do, from our beautifully designed cards and web application to our customer service 

Our mission is to preserve and cherish the art of typesetting, calligraphy and paper design. Our goal is to bring carefully and beautifully crafted invitation cards to you by partnering with talented local designers.Through our elegantly designed site and services we introduce our designers to the national stage and our customers to top talent.</p>

<p> Why invitations?<p>

<p>As Engineers and Designers, we love to build and create things with our hands and appreciate the mechanics of machines. Interestingly, we found all of those things we love in paper card making and of course software engineering. We love the classic print machinerys from the 1800s and the loud roaring sound of the printing presses. We noticed the process of mailing invitations hasn’t much changed since the conception of snail mail, there are several inefficiencies that can be addressed with the use of technology without compromising the old tradition of sending and receiving inked correspondences. 

So we said to ourselves, how do we marry the old and the new. How do we keep the art of card making, calligraphy printing and design alive in this age of emails and tweets? And why do we need to keep it alive? Because we believe messages inked on cards that you can touch and feel carry more weight and meaning.  We also believe the classic form of printing, letterpress is a form of art and needs to be cherished and shared. We want to tell the world that papermaking and printing is a form of classic art that needs to be preserved and valued. While we are big advocates of high tech, recycling paper and planting trees we believe that one doesn’t have to abandon the old to make way for the new. Instead we can integrate the new and the old and create something beautiful.</p>
